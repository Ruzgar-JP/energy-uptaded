**User's preferred language**: Turkish (The user communicates in Turkish, so all responses should be in Turkish.)

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application has been created from scratch. The backend is built with FastAPI and MongoDB, and the frontend is built with React and TailwindCSS. The initial version included user/admin authentication, project listings, a user dashboard, an admin panel, and a basic (mocked) deposit/withdrawal and KYC flow. The agent was in the process of implementing significant user feedback on this first version.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was updating the frontend components to implement user feedback. This included localizing all text to Turkish, changing fonts to better support Turkish characters, and reflecting new business logic for tiered investment returns. The last actions were a series of  commands on various frontend files like , , , and  to replace English text with Turkish.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N (for the new changes)
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** both (frontend and backend testing agents are required as changes affect both business logic and user interface).
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1:** Some  commands for frontend file localization failed or their success was not confirmed (Priority: P0).
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent tried viewing the file content to verify the strings to be replaced, but it's unclear if all required updates were successfully completed.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Review all frontend files under  and  to ensure all text is translated to Turkish.
        2.  Manually correct any remaining English text.
        3.  Verify that the font changes ( to ) have been applied correctly and that the new font supports Turkish characters like 'ş', 'ı', 'ğ' without issues. Check  and global CSS.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To fulfill the user's core requirement of having a fully Turkish website and to fix visual bugs related to incorrect character rendering.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y (The agent has run multiple  batches.)
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1:** Implement all changes from the user's latest feedback (Priority: P0).
    -   **Where to resume:** The backend logic for tiered returns is updated in . The frontend work is partially done. The next steps are:
        1.  **Dashboard Graphs:** Implement portfolio distribution, cost, and end-of-month return graphs in  using the  library.
        2.  **Return Calculator:** Add an interactive Getiri Hesaplama (Return Calculator) component to .
        3.  **Content Enrichment:** Add detailed content to the Nasıl Çalışır (How It Works) section on the .
        4.  **Finalize Localization:** Complete and verify the Turkish translation across the entire application (related to Issue 1).
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** The application will be updated to match the user's refined vision, with enhanced features, better usability, and complete localization.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both
    -   **Blocked on something:** None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
There are no new future tasks mentioned. The priority is to complete the current refinement and enhancement request.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Initial Application Build (V1):**
    -   Backend setup with FastAPI, MongoDB, and JWT/Google authentication.
    -   CRUD APIs for Projects, Banks, Users, and Transactions.
    -   Admin panel endpoints for user management, KYC approval, and bank configuration.
    -   Seed data for an admin user (), initial projects, and banks.
    -   Frontend structure with React, including pages for Landing, Login/Register, Dashboard, Projects, and a full Admin section.
    -   Initial testing with the testing agent, which yielded a 95% success rate on the frontend and 100% on the backend.
-   **Recent Backend Updates:**
    -   Modified investment logic in  to support tiered returns: 7% for 5k TL, 8% for 10k TL, and 10% for 20k+ TL.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   The localization  commands in  and  failed in one of the attempts. While the agent continued with other files, it's crucial to confirm these specific files were eventually corrected. This is now part of the pending **Issue 1**.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
You are picking up during a major refinement phase. The user wants significant enhancements over the first version. Your main goals are to implement the **dashboard graphs**, the **landing page return calculator**, and to finalize and verify the **full Turkish localization**, including fixing any remaining font-related character display issues. The backend logic for tiered returns is already in place in ; your focus will be primarily on the frontend implementation and then end-to-end testing.
